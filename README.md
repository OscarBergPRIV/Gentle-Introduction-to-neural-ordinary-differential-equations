# Gentle-Introduction-to-neural-ordinary-differential-equations

This repository contains a [gentle introduction to neural ordinary differential equations](neuralODE.md).
It explains the basic insights from [Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) and [Dupont et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01681)

The structure of the implementation in pyTorch is described, too.
